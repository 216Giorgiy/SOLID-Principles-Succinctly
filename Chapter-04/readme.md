#SOLID Succinctly - Chapter-04

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) provides a way to write and polish our programs in a better shape and way. These are basic points that guide us for how to write a good program.
For great Object Oriented Designs (OOD) we need to think beyond this. S.O.L.I.D principles provide us a way to write great design, yes there are certain design patterns, that guide us the same but SOLID exist much before these patterns.
