#SOLID Succinctly - Chapter-05
In this chapter we have gone through the Single Responsibility Principle, first principle which tells us about how to cater responsibilities and create a class to stick with only one/single responsibility. From the code example, we concluded this is a good practice to make our class descent, neat and clean so, it should be responsible for single operations, we can think so many operation, a class can bear what we canâ€™t think about the draw back and implications of that class which is overburden with so much responsibilities.
