#SOLID Succinctly - Chapter-06
In this chapter we have gone through the Open/Closed Principle, second principle which tells us about how to cater handle code base while interacting or writing for external parties.
With the help of code-example we have discussed and came to conclusion, a good class as per SOLID Principles is a class which does not allow code changes but we can extend that class for functionalities. There are more variations of the class but there should not be any possible reason where anyone can modify the code of an existing class.
